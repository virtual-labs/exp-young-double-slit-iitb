<h3>Theory</h3>

<p>The Young&#39;s Double Slit Experiment is a classic demonstration of the wave nature of light,
revealing the phenomenon of interference. In this experiment, a beam of monochromatic
light passes through two narrow slits, creating an interference pattern of alternating bright
and dark fringes on a screen placed behind the slits. This pattern results from the constructive and destructive interference of the light waves. In the procedure, the user
selects the wavelength of light using a slider, adjusts the distance between the slits and the
screen, and sets the slit width. The user is also tasked with measuring the distance of the
first and second-order maxima from the central maximum. Using these measurements, the
wavelength of light can be calculated with the interference formula. The experiment is
significant because it was one of the first to provide clear evidence that light behaves as a
wave, contradicting earlier particle theories of light and forming a foundational concept in
the study of wave optics.</p>


<p>Formula &lambda; = </p>

<ul>
<li>&lambda; - Wavelength of the light used </li>
<li>Y<sub>n</sub> – distance between central spot to n th maxima </li>
<li>n – order of diffraction </li>
<li>L – distance between slit and screen. </li>
<ul>
